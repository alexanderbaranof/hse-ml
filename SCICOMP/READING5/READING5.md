# Licensing and redistribution

## Code

Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

similarities:
- The author's name is required
- Modified files can be unmarked (MIT and BSD only)
- Derivative works may be distributed under the terms of another license
- Does not specify the territory for which the license is granted
- No software warranty
- Commercial Use Allowed



differences:
- The name of the derived software must be different from the product name of the license creators (Apache only)
- Modified files must be marked (Apache only)
- Patent rights allowed (Apache only)


## Art

Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

The picture is a graph of economic indicators in dynamics

- Using for illustration in a free online course
- Using a picture as an illustration in an article
- Showing a picture at a lecture on a projector

Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.

- the course may be free but the site sells ads
- the article can be written at the expense of the grant funds
- a lecture can be a commercial product


## Data

Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

I believe that the lack of an open data set in the articles prevents verification of the reproducibility of the result. It is impossible to repeat all the steps to make sure that the proposed method really works.

Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

The simplest and most useful example is book data sets. These sets allow you to learn different features of a language and teach language models. However, not all books, especially modern ones are available for use.
